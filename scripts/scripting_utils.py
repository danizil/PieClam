    #! it does manage to do feat optimization!! maybe there is a problem with fit funciton....
    #todo: how do i know the average distance of features? you can just compare them one time. but actually i want to know the distance of every node to the closest node and then take the as the noise amp... or twice that dunno

    #todo: what i expect to see in the score difference? not really sure, you are going in some direction might be direction of steep decoline....
